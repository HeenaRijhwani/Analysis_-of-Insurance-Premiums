# Analysis_-of-Insurance-Premiums
Many factors contribute towards the price of health insurance premiums. Some of these factors that impact the amount you pay are not within your control. I try to understand the factors - age, height, weight and if the individual has a family history of Cancer, and how much they affect insurance costs. 
1.Insurance companies consider one’s immediate family’s health history. Inherited conditions may cause these companies to increase premiums. In this project I explore if family history of Cancer affects insurance rates. I will be checking whether a family history of Cancer is associated with health care costs. 
2.Exploring if age, height, weight significant predictors of health care costs based on a multiple linear regression model and analyzing the contribution of age, height, weight separately towards insurance costs.
3.Checking if premium prices paid by people of different age groups is the same? (using One way ANOVA, Anova and regression). Further exploring if mean premium price paid by each pair of age groups is different? (using Tukey procedure).

Techniques used: Two sample t test, Correlation tests, Multiple Linear Regression model, Global F and subsequent t tests, One Way ANOVAs, Tukey procedure for pairwise comparisons, R.
